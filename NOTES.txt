FLEX CSS LAYOUTS!!!


Outer container:

display: flex;
flex-direction: row or column (row default)

justify-content: (this lets you evenly space or center or whatever the children of the
flex container) -- space-between, center, etc...

align-items: aligns along the cross axis (if in row mode, this means vertically)
(if in column mode, this means horizontally)

gap! This works like margins, adds gap between all children of the flex outer object


FLEX CHILDREN:
flex: (growth) (shrink) (flex-basis. Defaults to 0 but if in column mode, needs to be auto 
to make sure that a defined height is used for empty objects. Same with a fixed width start)

flex: 1 (common standard but could also just be flex-growth: 1)
